                <strong>Joe</strong><br> Hello, I'm Joe! I am a very active person, my main hobbies include mountain biking and skydiving! (crazy I know!) Amongst those activities I am always looking for new ways I can keep my life entertaining. Once
                I met Jess she has been a huge factor in making my life so much better! She inspired me to travel to various places which you will read about within this site. We are also looking at many more places to travel which will also be discussed
                within this site. One day we will hopefully be able to visit a vast array of countries and explore all around and invite you on this journey with us!<br> I hope to inspire you to live a life you love and settle for nothing less than extraordinary.<br>

                <strong>Jess</strong><br>I'm Jess. I have always loved travelling ever since I was a little girl. I come from a little rock called Cyprus. I have lived there for most of my life. During my time there I managed to explore the diverse
                island which has urban areas, beaches and mountains. For a traveller it is a must go to place because it is so small you will be able to see everything on the island. Since this island has shown me what it has to offer, I only have the
                drive to go and explore every other place in the world! We have created this site so we can share all the memories me and Joe will have with you all as well as a nice little site for us to keep a log of all our visits to enure that we
                will not forget them!<br>
